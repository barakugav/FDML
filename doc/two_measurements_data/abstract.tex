\begin{abstract}
A robot is placed inside a known polygonal workspace but in an unknown position and orientation. The robot is equipped with a distance sensor, namely a device that can measure the distance from the sensor to the nearest object in a given direction. For simplicity, let's assume that we only concern ourselves with the position $(x,y)$ of the sensor (rather than of the whole robot) and the orientation $\theta$ of the ray that measures the distance, namely the angle that the ray makes with the positive $x$-axis. Our goal is to determine where in the workspace our sensor could be, after carrying out two distance measurements.
